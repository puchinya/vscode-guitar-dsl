# Issue #162 Practice Guide evidence

These PNGs show the compact four-measure Practice Guide and tempo-linked bank fade captured in the VS Code 1.144.0 Extension Development Host on macOS arm64. The Japanese runs used the installed Japanese language pack; English runs used the default locale. The `review-v4` and `contract-v4` images are historical captures; the `practice-guide-v5` images show the current exact-path geometry at a 400px Preview width.

The 52 `review-v4` and 52 `contract-v4` compact/grid/chord/sample PNGs are historical captures. The complete v4 matrix has 32 compact-layout PNGs, 12 grid PNGs, four short-chord PNGs, and four `sample_gozen0jino_page` PNGs. They have valid PNG headers, the expected CSS-pixel width, nonzero height, and at least 20 KB. Their E2E checked computed lyric contrast, technique-anchor geometry, canonical wave `d` and stroke width, per-grid wave counts and Fractions, and the v4 equal X/Y SVG scale. At 400 px and grid 16, the original 12px wave SVG was retained and uniformly scaled; recognition below the 12px reference interval was not required. Representative v4 compact layouts and the 16th-note grid were visually inspected in both locales and themes. The earlier review-v3 compact/grid images remain historical evidence. The 16 fade reference/phase images retain the earlier visual capture at source commit `c7d1f9d2f992041ceffc9f77e99ea5b21f6e5ddd`; the fade lifecycle is covered by current-HEAD tests below.

The v4 portrait-geometry/rest PNGs are each exactly 400 × 699 pixels and approximately 52 KB. Their E2E checked the 10 × 36 compact attack viewBox, 5 × 5 arrowhead, shaft height of at least 27 local units, uniform X/Y scaling, all four fixed technique colors, opacity 1, and 1.7–2.0 local stroke widths. The computed colors are normal `#1f2937`, past `#475569`, next `#37465e`, and current `#005f85`; their sRGB contrast ratios against white are 14.68:1, 7.58:1, 9.54:1, and 7.06:1. The E2E also verified zero compact melody-rest nodes, the unchanged following pitch-bar beat/duration, and retained rests in the detailed grid. These are retained as historical v4 images.

The four v5 images are each exactly 400 × 699 pixels. Each capture was made from the Extension Development Host with the compact guide visible, four measure cards, melody lane, and sixteen horizontal attacks per measure. The v5 E2E checked the 4 × 30 attack viewBox, exact shaft and arrowhead path bounds, at least 26 CSS px of visible shaft, a 1.0–1.2 CSS px non-scaling stroke, X-only compression, zero overlap, continuation waves, PM marks, fixed state colors/opacity, and blank compact melody rests while preserving the detailed-grid rests. I visually inspected all four images for the JA/EN and Light/Dark rendering and the four-measure horizontal layout. These captures were taken from the current PR source state; the exact HEAD is recorded in [`implementation-status.md`](../../implementation-status.md).

The v5 exact-path images are the current stroke-geometry evidence. The v4 matrix and portrait/rest images are retained as earlier contract evidence, and the earlier fade images are retained as references for transition phases; their source commits are shown above. E2E reruns and the implementation source commit are recorded in [`implementation-status.md`](../../implementation-status.md).

## PR #163 review evidence

The compact chord edge regression uses 2, 3, and 4 chord intervals in one four-measure page at an exact 400 CSS px Preview width. Chord diagrams stay in one horizontal row in playback order; each pair scales to its available interval spacing. The E2E checks the name/diagram pair and center, reads both DOM bounds against the card, confirms finger dots, and verifies that neighboring diagrams do not overlap.

Contract v5 adds the exact attack/wave paths from the supplied reference pattern. The crop and its exact SVG target are kept beside the rendered captures for direct visual review.

- The compact width/melody matrix, grid 4/8/16, short-chord, and sample images were refreshed for all four locale/theme combinations in the Contract v4 E2E runs.

The refreshed `sample_gozen0jino_page` capture verifies that dense stroke symbols remain in one horizontal row in the compact guide. Contract v5 adds the exact 4 × 30 attack paths and short 5.6 × 30 continuation paths; only the X dimension compresses, while vertical geometry and the non-scaling stroke are preserved. A focused E2E checks exact beat anchors, visual offsets for simultaneous marks, canonical continuation-wave paths and stroke width through grid4/8/16 transitions, exact wave counts/Fractions, X-only scaling, accessible names, non-overlap, and card containment at 320–1600 CSS px and melody on/off.
