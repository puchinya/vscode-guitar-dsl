# Implementation phase

Read this file only while the associated Issue is in `phase:ready` or `phase:implementation`.

## Starting work

Before editing:

1. Re-read the approved Issue specification and acceptance criteria.
2. Confirm that no newer comment or linked decision supersedes the Issue body.
3. If the task was supplied as an Implementation Contract, follow the mirror gate below.
4. Run `scripts/agent/prepare-self-review.sh <issue-number>` or the PowerShell equivalent and confirm the generated effective checklist matches the approved task.
5. For source-code changes, create/switch through `scripts/agent/start-feature-branch.sh <issue> <short-description>` or the PowerShell equivalent. Its branch name is authoritative for source work.
6. An actual helper-driven branch switch removes stale `out/` compilation artifacts (`rm -rf out/`); this build artifact invariant must not be optimized away.
7. Replace `phase:ready` with `phase:implementation`.
8. Confirm required upstream spec/design updates are approved before code editing.

Documentation/workflow-only changes may use the existing `docs/` or `agent/` branch allowance.

The approved Issue defines repository task scope. A compatible supplied contract is a compressed decision-complete handoff, not an override of normative specs/design.

## Supplied Implementation Contract mirror

After Issue ownership exists and before detailed implementation work, save the exact supplied contract:

```bash
scripts/agent/save-implementation-contract.sh <issue-number> <contract-file>
```

or on PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\agent\save-implementation-contract.ps1 <issue-number> <contract-file>
```

The mirror lives at:

```text
.agent-state/issues/<issue-number>/implementation-contract.md
.agent-state/issues/<issue-number>/implementation-contract.sha256
```

The helper is immutable-on-conflict and idempotent-on-match. Never silently replace a different existing contract.

If the mirror exists, re-read it:

- after context compaction;
- after session resume/handoff;
- before the final complete-diff self-review.

Do not duplicate the contract into another persistent context summary.

Supplied contracts may include the paste-safe `AGENT_REVIEWER_CHECKLIST_V1_BEGIN` / `END` block (or legacy `ELWINDUI_REVIEWER_CHECKLIST_V1_BEGIN` / `END`). Preparation and validation use that canonical block before legacy Markdown Reviewer Checklist extraction; this preserves checklist semantics across rendered chat copy/paste. Direct Issue checklists and approved Issue supplements remain standard Markdown.

## Context-efficient execution

Use `scripts/agent/agent-context.* <issue-number>` for compact routing/bootstrap state.

Keep only the Issue-scoped working set described in `AGENTS.md`. Inspect referenced files/symbols for implementation details, but do not broadly re-derive architecture already resolved by an approved compatible contract unless repository evidence conflicts.

Keep large output in `.agent-state/issues/<issue>/logs/` and inspect bounded excerpts.

## Implementation rules

- Stay inside approved scope.
- Do not mix unrelated refactoring/cleanup.
- Preserve repository authority and architectural invariants.
- Do not expose backend-specific types through common APIs without approval.
- Do not add dependencies without an approved reason.
- Add/update tests for behavior and acceptance criteria.
- Synchronize only documentation whose responsibility actually changed:
  - public contract -> `docs/specs/`
  - durable architecture -> `docs/design/`
  - concise current implementation/gap/verification state -> `docs/status/`
- Keep evidence/history in Issue/PR/evidence artifacts, not `docs/status/`.

If code/spec/design conflict requires a material public API, compatibility, ownership, backend-boundary, threading, dependency, non-goal, or acceptance change, stop and return to `phase:design`.

A material requirement discovered during implementation that is missing from the effective checklist follows the same return-to-requirements/design rule. Do not silently add a design decision or checklist obligation in the implementation phase.

## GitHub Markdown and image evidence

For multiline Issue updates/comments, Pull Request bodies, PR comments, and review bodies, use `--body-file` when the `gh` command supports it. The source file must already contain real newline characters; use `--body` only for genuinely single-line text and never use literal \n as a substitute for an intended line break.

Useful implementation or test screenshots SHOULD be attached to the owning Issue with `gh --attach`. For any task that modifies visual rendering, score notation, SVG output, or webview appearance, generating and attaching rendered preview image evidence (SVG/PNG) is **MANDATORY**, and must be presented to the user during self-review and delivery. This workflow uses Issue attachments for images only. A required image upload is complete only after checking the resulting Issue/comment and confirming that the expected image asset or link is present; a missing or partial upload cannot be reported as PASS.

Keep full Implementation Contracts and raw logs in the existing local Issue-scoped state. Do not paste or convert them into Issue attachments.
Do not rewrite historical Issue descriptions or comments merely because they contain literal \n.
Do not attach videos or generic/textual artifacts.

## Verification

`docs/agents/testing.md` is the sole verification command authority.

During the edit/debug loop, use the narrowest relevant check/test. Do not repeatedly run the complete workspace/final gate merely as a progress probe.

Once an extension-affecting change is stable, run the complete mandatory verification gate before PR delivery. If review remediation occurs, use focused checks while editing, then rerun the complete gate once the remediation is stable.

Record commands/results honestly, including untested environments.

## Self-review

The final self-review contains both the existing generic checks below and every item in the effective task-specific Reviewer Checklist. Stabilize the implementation first, run required verification, commit repository-controlled changes, and confirm the worktree is clean before recording the final review.

Before setting `Reviewed-HEAD`, refresh the checklist with `prepare-self-review.* <issue-number>` to detect source drift, inspect the complete committed task diff against the current remote default branch, judge every task-specific item as `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `N/A`, and record concrete evidence for every `PASS` or a concrete reason for every `N/A`. Set `Reviewed-HEAD` to the current full commit SHA and run `validate-self-review.* <issue-number>`. Any validator failure blocks PR delivery.

Generic repository self-review:

1. If a contract mirror exists, verify its SHA/integrity with `scripts/agent/agent-context.*` and re-read the exact contract.
2. Inspect the complete diff.
3. Verify every acceptance criterion is satisfied or explicitly incomplete.
4. Verify implementation matches approved Issue/design/contract decisions.
5. Verify no unrelated changes.
6. Verify tests cover important normal/boundary/failure behavior.
7. Verify specs/design/status/Agent paths remain synchronized.
8. Verify status contains current state rather than PR/evidence history.
9. Verify error handling, unsafe assumptions, generated files, and lockfile changes are intentional.

The final review must not be marked complete while implementation changes remain uncommitted. A new commit, source change, missing item, `PENDING`, `FAIL`, stale checklist, stale `Reviewed-HEAD`, or missing evidence requires the review gate to be performed again.

## Implementation completion gate

Before reporting implementation-phase completion:

- changes are committed;
- `validate-self-review.* <issue-number>` passes with the complete effective checklist and current committed HEAD;
- branch is pushed;
- PR exists and contains `Closes #<issue-number>`;
- Issue transitioned to `phase:review`;
- `docs/agent-workflow/review.md` has been entered.

If PR creation or phase transition fails, report the task as blocked with the exact command/error.

## Transition to review

1. Update the Issue acceptance checklist and only a concise implementation status.
2. Put delta/evidence/risk/reviewer guidance in the PR; do not restate the whole Issue/contract.
   Include only a concise self-review summary: checklist source(s), checklist SHA-256, reviewed HEAD, PASS/N/A/FAIL counts, and validator result. Keep item-level results in `.agent-state`.
3. Create the PR with `Closes #<issue-number>`.
4. Replace `phase:implementation` with `phase:review`.
5. Read `docs/agent-workflow/review.md`.

Use `gh` for GitHub operations and `git` for local branch/commit/push.
